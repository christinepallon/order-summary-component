## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time doing a mobile-first workflow! I'm going to continue using this workflow for future projects. I noticed how much quicker I was able to get this project done compared to the product preview project two days ago. Just after a few small projects, I'm a lot better at navigating CSS, which is a really good feeling. 

### Continued development

In my next projects, I want to get used to using variables for colors, etc. Further, all of my projects thus far have been larger than the ones in the examples. It still looks fine, but I want to figure out how to get them closer to the intended size.
